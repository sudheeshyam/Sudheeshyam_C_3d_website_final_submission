        <h1>sloth bear</h1>
        <h2>The sloth bear (Melursus ursinus) is a myrmecophagous bear species native to the<br> Indian subcontinent. It feeds on fruits, ants and termites. It is listed as vulnerable on the<br> IUCN Red List, mainly because of habitat loss and degradation.

            It has also been called <br>"labiated bear" because of its long lower lip and palate used for sucking up insects. <br>It has a long, shaggy fur, a mane around the face, and long, sickle-shaped claws.<br>It is lankier than brown and Asian black bears. It shares features of insectivorous<br> mammals and evolved during the Pleistocene from the ancestral brown bear through divergent<br> evolution.
            
            Sloth bears breed during spring and early summer and give birth near the <br>beginning of winter. When their territories are encroached upon by humans, <br>they sometimes attack them. Historically, humans have drastically reduced these <br>bears' habitat and diminished their population by hunting them for food and products <br>such as their bacula and claws. Sloth bears have been tamed and used as performing animals <br>and as pets.</h2>
