        <h1>elephant</h1>
        <h2>Elephants are the largest existing land animals. Three living species are currently recognised:<br>the African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant.<br> They are an informal grouping within the proboscidean family Elephantidae.<br> Elephantidae is the only surviving family of proboscideans; extinct members include the <br>mastodons. Elephantidae also contains several extinct groups, including the mammoths and<br> straight-tusked elephants. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs, whereas <br>Asian elephants have smaller ears, and convex or level backs. The distinctive features of all <br>elephants include a long proboscis called a trunk, tusks, large ear flaps, massive legs, <br>and tough but sensitive skin. The trunk is used for breathing, bringing food and water to the <br>mouth, and grasping objects. Tusks, which are derived from the incisor teeth,<br> serve both as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. The large ear flaps <br>assist in maintaining a constant body temperature as well as in communication. The pillar-like<br> legs carry their great weight. </h2>
